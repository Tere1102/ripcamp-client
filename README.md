# Ingeina

Ingeina is a **collaborative Single Page Application (SPA)** built with React, designed to connect current web and data bootcamp students with alumni. The platform encourages networking, mentorship, and community building within the tech ecosystem, providing a space for **queries, questions, or technical help** among students and alumni.

This project was developed as a **team project** during a web development bootcamp, organizing ourselves collaboratively to plan, distribute tasks, and complete the project together.
