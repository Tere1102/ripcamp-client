                                        Your game must meet the following technical requirements:
                                        Render a game in the browser.
                                        Have logic for winning and/or losing and show feedback to the player in either case:
                                        Your game must have logic that allows the player to win or lose.
                                        Your game code must be organized in separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                                        Use plain JavaScript for DOM manipulation.
                                        Your game entities and elements must be organized using classes and OOP.
                                        Have a repo on GitHub.
                                        Have at least one (1) commit per day that you worked on.
                                        You must deploy your game online using GitHub Pages so anyone can play it.
                                        Your code should follow the principles of KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself).{' '}

                                        Technical requirements:
                                        Create a Single Page Application (SPA), using React, consisting of multiple views.
                                        The React application should be integrated with either a mock backend or an external API and should perform all CRUD
                                        (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on that API.
                                        Your project should be deployed online, allowing anyone to access and use your app.
                                        Have your project available on a GitHub repository. If your project includes a mock
                                        back-end API you should have two GitHub repositories - one for your front-end React application and the other for your back-end API.
                                        Have at least 2 commits per day on your project repository that you worked on.
                                        As a final step, check all the features outlined in points 1 - 3 and ensure they are implemented and working ahead of delivery.{' '}
